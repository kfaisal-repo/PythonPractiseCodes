Exercise 12 - calendar operations is used
Exersice 13 is very important- map function and unpack a list using * operator.
Exersice - popular question - if a list has size of 100 crores and all elements are same. In the least possible time,
how can I verify if all elements are really same or not. use set() function - because set cannot have duplicate. hence size of set should be 1.
